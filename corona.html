                <h3>
                    Here is one of the book I wrote
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Deep in the forest, where many strange creatures live. Ethan and his father live even farther down the woods, but on the other hand, there is a village that hates the beast who took their food every two weeks.
                    The villager knows that Ethan and his father live there, and they dislike it because of their back story. Ten years ago, Ethan's father, Alex, was a clever man, he told the village that the animals in the forest
                     would weaken the town. But the city didn't believe such things like that, so they kicked him into the woods and told him that "Alex would never allow going back." Alex was scared, but he wasn't worried, he knew
                     that he was a clever man. He promised that he would never go back to the village just when Alex saw a big monster eating â€¦its claws were sharp that leave a mark, its teeth were sharp that it could chew to anything,
                      Alex was scared so he ran deep inside the forest and created a hut. 

                    Then years past Ethan, Alex's son grew up as an intelligent guy too, but Alex never allowed Ethan to go outside the house. Ethan grew up and became more talented, but he was never, ever allowed to go outside the hut.
                     Alex was anxious that the monster would eat Ethan, so Alex kept Ethan close. Alex kept Ethan to keep a low profile because he doesn't want the villagers to know that Alex and his son live deep down the forest.

                    One day, Ethan was asleep, when he heard a big sound coming from the forest, it was so loud that a piece of roof fell where Ethan was standing. The floor is shaking as it has never been that bad. Alex's father ran to the room.
                    "What happens in here, son."
                    "Nothing, dad, but I think, is an earthquake."
                    "Ok, I guess we needed to fix the roof."
                    "That right."

                    Ethan took the hammer and a sword, but he hid the sword behind and said, "Can I go outside just to fix the roof," and guess what his dad said yes. Ethan ran outside, but he didn't climb the ladder, he ran forward! After
                     running  Ethan was tired of running,

                    For the people who are lonely and don't have any sibling, I think you could talk to yourself to make you better<br>

                    ing with yourself is you can find out that you and yourself have a lot in command than your friend. Some of the<br>
                    best way to do it is talk to yourself in front of a mirror.
